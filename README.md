Objectives:
  -Implement a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous target variables.
  -Split the data into training and testing sets.
  -Train the model on the training data.
  -Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
  -Make predictions on the test set.
  -Visualize the regression line and actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy.

Key Activities:
  1.Data Loading: Load the dataset using pandas.
  2.Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values and perform any necessary data cleaning.
  3.Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  4.Model Training: Train a simple linear regression model on the training data.
  5.Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
  6.Predictions: Make predictions on the test set.
  7.Visualization:
    -Plot the regression line.
    -Visualize actual vs. predicted values.

Technologies Used:
  -Python: The programming language used for the analysis and modeling.
  -pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  -numpy: For numerical operations.
  -scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
  -matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
  -seaborn: For statistical data visualization.

Key Insights:
 1.Model Performance: The model's performance is evaluated using MSE and R², which indicate how well the model fits the data.
 2.Regression Line: The regression line provides a visual representation of the relationship between the feature and the target variable.
 3.Actual vs. Predicted Values: The scatter plot of actual vs. predicted values helps in assessing the model's accuracy and identifying any systematic errors
